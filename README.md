# How to play

Each row and column has numbers next to it. These numbers tell you how many blocks of filled squares are in that row/column. For example, 4 2 means there is a block of 4 filled squares, followed by a block of 2, with at least one empty square between them. The order matters. If a row says 2 1, you must first place 2 filled squares, then some space, then 1 filled square — in that order. Use logic to figure out where the filled squares go. Don’t guess — use the clues in rows and columns together to find the solution step by step. Mark empty cells to help you. Many players mark empty squares with an X or dot to track where not to place blocks. Finish when the entire grid matches the clues. If all clues are satisfied, you’ll have a complete pixel-art picture
